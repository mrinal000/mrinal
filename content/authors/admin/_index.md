Hi! Thank you very much for visiting my website. I am a mid-level research professional with a thing for music and photography. I have decent experience in designing public health research and monitoring plan, collecting and analyzing data and writing. I strive to LEARN NEW THINGS, which has always given me an edge in being at my best.
